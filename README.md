# NPR-Portfolio

These are a few of the assignments I've worked on in the past 6 weeks, using mapping skills, Python, data scraping, selenium, and Leaflet. Currently, I'm in the second half of an immersive program at Columbia University studying Data Journalism, and will be completing 6 projects in the next 6 weeks. My program wraps up September 1.
